# SeeSatVB
Satellite tracking application written in VB.Net with Visual Studio 2013 IDE
Alan Madill - Aspen House Systems - 2015
The SGP4 code comes from http://www.projectpluto.com/sat_code.htm <http://www.projectpluto.com/sat_code.htm>.  The original routines were written by Dr. T. S. Kelso (though he wasn't credited with it in the source).  I've managed to get that into a working DLL.  Some of the code for sun elevation, observer to sat alt/azm, ra/dec and such are Paul Hirose's SeeSat code translated into VB.NET.  The user interface and routines that read the McCants and Molczan visual info and star data are written in VB.NET using Visual Studio 2013.
